# Avocado-Sales-US
This project aims to understand avocado demand and assess the current state of the avocado industry by highlighng trends in avocado sales in 45 major U.S.
cies. Using 7,200 datapoints from the first 20 weeks of each year from 2017-2020, we found that demand increased 25% since 2017, while average selling price decreased 7%
over the same period. However, average selling price is not strongly correlated with the number of units sold. Addionally, we idenfied which weeks are
associated with increased avocado consumption. Analysis performed using Excel and Tableau Public. PowerPoint file has an executive presentation of this analysis.
